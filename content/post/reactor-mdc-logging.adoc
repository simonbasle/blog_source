In this post, we'll look at how to combine the MDC feature of current logging framework
with https://projectreactor.io/[Reactor]'s own `Context`, in order to make contextualized logging possible within
a reactive application.

_:warning: *update*: see the bottom note for a bug with doOnEach to be aware of in `3.1.3.RELEASE` and below_

## The need

Let's imagine that we have an API that lists restaurants in your area, under a requested price.
It simply interrogates a database and logs the found restaurants in the console.

Only problem is, whenever two customers request the API at the same time, sometimes their
logs are mixed and you don't have a way to find out who got what

To simulate such a situation we can issue two `HTTPie` footnote:[`HTTPie` is curl for humans :+1: https://httpie.org] calls:
[source,bash]
----
$ http :8080/byPrice maxPrice==12 & http :8080/byPrice maxPrice==11
----

Usually, one solution would be to use the `MDC` feature of logging frameworks like Logback
(SLF4J has a MDC abstraction that will delegate to the equivalent in the underlying
framework if it has such a feature). You can put key-value pairs in the MDC and
refer to the keys in your logging appender's pattern, and the values will magically
appear in the logs.

For instance, to solve our logging issue we could ask that every user puts its
userId in an HTTP request header, and then use that id as a differentiator in the
MDC:
[source,ini]
----
logging.pattern.console=%magenta([%thread]) %cyan([%X{apiID}]) - %highlight(%-5level) %logger{36}.%M - %msg%n <1>
----
<1> notice the `%X{apiID}`, that's our MDC key

## The issue
This is all good and well in eg. a Spring MVC app, where the Servlet model results
in 1 `Thread` per request, because the MDC implementations are based on `ThreadLocal`.

Uh-oh. If you've done some reactive programming before, you'll probably start to
feel a bit uneasy at this point :sweat_smile:

In a reactive programming library like Reactor, `ThreadLocal` is not ideal because
execution of an asynchronous pipeline can easily hop threads, and threads can also
easily be shared between unrelated pipelines.

If we implement the restaurant API as a Spring WebFlux application like this:

[source,java]
----
@GetMapping("/byPrice")
public Flux<Restaurant> byPrice(@RequestParam Double maxPrice, 
    @RequestHeader(required = false, name = "X-UserId") String uid) { <1>
	String apiId = uid == null ? "" : uid;
	MDC.put("apiID", apiId); <2>
	return restaurantService.byPrice(maxPrice)
	                        .doOnNext(r -> LOG.debug("found restaurant {} for ${}", r.getName(), r.getPricePerPerson())); <3>
}
----
<1> We get the user id from the headers
<2> We attempt to put it in the MDC...
<3> ...and log the results

.We can execute the 2 concurrent requests with `HTTPie`:
[source]
----
$  http :8080/byPrice maxPrice==12 X-UserId:foo & http :8080/byPrice maxPrice==11 X-UserId:bar
----

But we get the following (disappointing) logs:
----
[reactor-http-nio-6] [bar] - DEBUG apiIdLogger.byPrice - finding restaurants for under $11.0 for %bar
[reactor-http-nio-7] [foo] - DEBUG apiIdLogger.byPrice - finding restaurants for under $12.0 for %foo
[byPrice-1] [] - DEBUG apiIdLogger.lambda$byPrice$3 - found restaurant Burger for $11.0
[byPrice-1] [] - DEBUG apiIdLogger.lambda$byPrice$3 - found restaurant DoMONOs for $10.0
[byPrice-1] [] - DEBUG apiIdLogger.lambda$byPrice$3 - found restaurant Cheesecake ProxyFactory for $9.5
[byPrice-1] [] - DEBUG apiIdLogger.lambda$byPrice$3 - found restaurant DoMONOs for $10.0
[byPrice-1] [] - DEBUG apiIdLogger.lambda$byPrice$3 - found restaurant Cheesecake ProxyFactory for $9.5
----

Oh snap!

 * The MDC was taken into account for the first log statement but not the others :thinking:
 * The service seems to offset the work on another thread :disappointed:
 * The work is done on a single thread, different from the one where user ids are logged :boom:
 * Worse, *it's the same thread for both requests* :boom::scream::boom:
 
## The solution
Reactor comes with a `Context` in which one can put data to be associated with a particular
`Flux` rather than a `Thread`. Maybe we can somehow use this :thinking:

In reactive terms, log statements are usually considered as something to be
executed _on the side_ of the pipeline, since it doesn't change the sequence's
data. We recommend to isolate these "side effects" in the `doOn*` family of operators.

One such operator is a particularly good candidate for our contextual logging need:
`doOnEach` let you consume a `Signal` object that materialize each reactive events,
`onNext` data events and `onComplete`/`onError` terminal events alike.

What's more interesting is that since version `3.1.3`, it also provides access
to the current `Context` :+1: :tada:

So the idea would be to isolate log statements in `doOnEach` and write a bit of
boilerplate code to fill the MDC, do the logging and clear the MDC (we want to be
good citizens here):

[source,java]
----
private static <T> void logOnNext(Signal<T> signal, Consumer<T> logStatement) {
	if (!signal.isOnNext()) return; <1>
	Optional<String> apiIDMaybe = signal.getContext().getOrEmpty("apiID"); <2>

	apiIDMaybe.ifPresentOrElse(apiID -> {
		try (MDC.MDCCloseable closeable = MDC.putCloseable("apiID", apiID)) { <3>
			logStatement.accept(signal.get()); <4>
		}
	}, () -> logStatement.accept(signal.get())); <4>
}
----
<1> We only care to log for onNext events
<2> We'll extract the interesting value from the Reactor `Context`
<3> If present, we'll put it in the MDC and automatically clear it once the line
below is done
<4> We execute the log statement provided as a consumer of the `onNext` value

With that boilerplate logging function, we can rewrite our controller to reactively
log the request results:

[source,java]
----
@GetMapping("/byPrice")
public Flux<Restaurant> byPrice(@RequestParam Double maxPrice, @RequestHeader(required = false, name = "X-UserId") String userId) {
	String apiId = userId == null ? "" : userId;
	<3>
	return restaurantService.byPrice(maxPrice))
	           .doOnEach(sig -> logOnNext(sig, r -> LOG.debug("found restaurant {} for ${}", r.getName(), r.getPricePerPerson()))) <2>
	           .subscriberContext(Context.of("apiID", apiId)); <1>
}
----
<1> The `subscriberContext` method is used at the bottom of the chain to enrich the `Context` (here with `apiId`)
<2> Every operator above it will see the `Context`, including our boilerplate logging `doOnEach`
<3> :warning: something is missing here.

The missing part above is the initial log. We could put the value in the MDC and
then call the `LOG` directly like before, but let's be reactive all the way:

[source,java]
----
@GetMapping("/byPrice")
public Flux<Restaurant> byPrice(@RequestParam Double maxPrice, @RequestHeader(required = false, name = "X-UserId") String userId) {
	String apiId = userId == null ? "" : userId;
	return Mono.just(String.format("finding restaurants for under $%.2f for %s", maxPrice, apiId)) <1>
	           .doOnEach(sig -> logOnNext(sig, msg -> LOG.debug(msg))) <2>
	           .thenMany(restaurantService.byPrice(maxPrice)) <3>
	           .doOnEach(sig -> logOnNext(sig, r -> LOG.debug("found restaurant {} for ${}", r.getName(), r.getPricePerPerson())))
	           .subscriberContext(Context.of("apiID", apiId));
}
----
<1> Generate an initial message as the starting point
<2> Use our boilerplate logging method (`doOnNext` sees our prepared message as the value to log)
<3> _then_ replace and continue the sequence with the _Many_ elements from the `restaurantService` call using `thenMany`

And _voil√†_ the result:

----
[reactor-http-nio-6] [bar] - DEBUG apiIdLogger.lambda$byPrice$3 - finding restaurants for under $11.00 for bar
[reactor-http-nio-7] [foo] - DEBUG apiIdLogger.lambda$byPrice$3 - finding restaurants for under $12.00 for foo
[byPrice-1] [foo] - DEBUG apiIdLogger.lambda$byPrice$5 - found restaurant Burger for $11.0
[byPrice-1] [bar] - DEBUG apiIdLogger.lambda$byPrice$5 - found restaurant DoMONOs for $10.0
[byPrice-1] [bar] - DEBUG apiIdLogger.lambda$byPrice$5 - found restaurant Cheesecake ProxyFactory for $9.5
[byPrice-1] [foo] - DEBUG apiIdLogger.lambda$byPrice$5 - found restaurant DoMONOs for $10.0
[byPrice-1] [foo] - DEBUG apiIdLogger.lambda$byPrice$5 - found restaurant Cheesecake ProxyFactory for $9.5
----

Results from two requests interleaved in logs from the same `Thread`, but we can
still identify who got what. *WIN* :grin:

{{% alert warning %}}
Following the writing of this post, an issue with `doOnEach` was discovered that leads to the
operator being bypassed in some configurations (asynchronous fusion). This will be fixed in
`3.1.4.RELEASE`, and in the meantime you can put a `.hide()` just *before* the `.doOnEach(...)`.
