I've finally decided to **start writing a Blog** :smile:

<!--more-->

On the technical side, I'll go with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), with the beautiful
and complete [Academic](https://themes.gohugo.io/academic/) Theme :art: :tada:

> Hugo is one of the most popular open-source static site generators. It is written in Go.

In this blog, I intend to post mostly **technical content**, the majority of which
will probably be my ramblings about programming in general (and in Java
in particular), tips and tools, technical snippets or solutions I come across
in my work... But I don't exclude to also post content completely unrelated to
programming :+1:

I'll also link to some of my talks (and show upcoming talks if I get accepted
at conferences)...
